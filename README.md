# Robust Ground Truth from Continuous Annotations
This repository provides the figures, code, and results for the submitted publication:

Brandon M. Booth, Shri S. Narayanan. "People Make Mistakes: Obtaining Accurate Ground Truth from Continuous Annotations of Subjective Constructs." Transactions on Affective Computing, 2023. [under review]

## Directories
1. *figures* - Contains TeX (tikz), PNG, and [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) formatted files used to generate figures in the paper
1. *results* - Holds annotation results in two pilot studies (pilot1, pilot2) and the main experiment (study), including annotations, ordinal comparisons, and all intermediate results at various stages of ground truth pipeline processing
1. *scripts* - Has all code used to assemble the dataset, collect annotations, generate the baseline and proposed ground truth (see figure below), and analyze and plot the results. Command line options for each script are documented in the code.
