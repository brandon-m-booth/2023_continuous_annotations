Close-ups of characters shot dead. Hand-to-hand fights in which a man and a woman punch, kick, stab, choke, and wrestle each other. People are shot, stabbed, blown up, crashed into, and poisoned. One character tries but fails to slit someone's throat (she wounds him but doesn't kill). A character's car blows up, killing three innocent people. Several chase scenes in which villains are shooting at the main character and trying to run her off the road."

Vicious wolves chase Anna and Kristoff on a sleigh. Elsa creates a very menacing snow monster and accidentally hurts Anna again. Men with guns and bows try to hurt Elsa. The queen is imprisoned and sentenced to be executed. Anna's heart begins to freeze, and it seems likely her whole body will turn to ice.

Several flashbacks to battle that involves weapons (mostly swords), injury, danger, nongraphic death (we're told of one death, and one other person is obviously killed -- they're shown moments before assassination). The sisters find remains of their parents' shipwreck in an unexpected place, which makes them sad; other references to their parents' deaths. Frequent peril and risk: Chases, smashing, panic, falls, etc. Enchanted Forest can be scary: enormous Earth giants are initially frightening (especially when they hurl boulders at people), as is a water horse. Air spirits use a tornado-like cloud to roughly grab, spin main characters. Elsa is repeatedly tossed around by huge waves. Various elemental spirits (air, earth, fire, water) magically threaten Arendelle; the whole kingdom is in danger at a couple of different points; citizens must be evacuated. Billowing smoke and swirling, magical-looking fire that burns quickly and endangers characters. Definite spoiler alert! At one point it looks like Elsa has frozen permanently, and Olaf melts/flurries away as a result (little kids may be quite upset by this, but it's not permanent) -- Anna is extremely sad after that scene."

One particularly horrific scene shows a man being sucked into a fiery vortex screaming and pleading. Another man is shown in a vehicle as it's sucked up into the air and then comes slamming down, instantly killing him.

There are three animated segments of this film where dark, menacing music is used to intensify scary visual effects. In “The Steadfast Tin Soldier” an evil jack-in-the-box, with bared teeth and sinister eyes, threatens a ballerina and the tin soldier who loves her. He pops up, looms large over his prey, and chases them accompanied by lots of scary rodents with mean red eyes. In “The Firebird Suite” the visual story is one of life, death, and renewal. Fire, giant birds of prey, and red-eyed creatures fill the screen with menace and ominous images. Finally, in “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” taken directly from the original Fantasia, Mickey Mouse is a young wizard who cannot control the frenzied brooms that his magic has set in motion. The result is an intense storm, a giant whirlpool, and waves of water completely overpowering the scene."

A man stabs another man through the neck with the stem of a broken wineglass. A man is killed by having a chair leg thrust through his face. A man is seen devouring another man's kidneys after murdering him. A man is hurled into an industrial glass crusher; viewers see his face, stripped bare of skin and pouring blood (later his face is a grotesque patchwork of scars, grafts, and transplants).

The fights with Ivan, including the climactic sequence, are the most violent, but there's almost no blood.

There's a pervasive sense of peril and tension, and once the Games start, there's an immediate bloodbath, with vicious weapon use, a fair amount of blood, and several dead bodies -- though the quick editing means that the most gruesome bits aren't lingered on. The young combatants proceed to die from spears, arrows, knives, deadly insect bites, attack by genetically modified dog-like creatures, and poisonous berries (some deaths occur off camera). A couple of the tributes also have their necks snapped or heads bashed. The Gamemakers purposely devise situations to try and kill off characters, including a scary fire with fireball projectiles; another scene has a large explosion.

The movies within the movie are even gorier than the feature film, featuring gross torture sequences. In one case, a girl is forced to place an item inside her stomach, so her insides are visible.

Possible spoiler alert: Elinor's transformation into a bear is mostly funny, but in one scene that could upset younger kids, she becomes more bear than mother and growls menacingly at Merida. Young kids might also be frightened when the men (including Fergus) take arms against bear-Elinor and are set on killing her. The climactic battle between the bears and the clan gets very tense, especially when it looks like Merida or Elinor will be hurt. Some of the scenes with the witch may also be scary for kids -- she's mostly harmless, but her hut is spooky, and she comes off as creepy herself. The will o' the wisps are eerie and a bit ominous.

Chris is depicted as sadistic; she cuts a pig's throat, pours a bucket of pig's blood on Carrie, and later tries to run over her with a car. Mrs. White self harms by cutting herself and is abusive toward Carrie (she tries to kill her as a newborn and later in the film stabs her). Carrie uses her telekinesis in disturbing ways: she impales people, sets rooms on fire, turns over a car and makes objects hit people. A teenage boy is killed when a bucket falls on his head. There are few close-ups of dead or nearly dead characters. A guy threatens his girlfriend if she gets them arrested."

The military gets involved and plans a SEAL mission to try and save the captain, and they have instructions to take out his captors. One of the pirates is a teenager who is seriously hurt when he steps on shattered glass. Phillips is severely beaten. One bullet to the head results in blood/brain spatter on the wall."

Many, many people are trapped, held hostage, killed, tortured, and executed, and Bruce Wayne himself is injured in painful, nearly irreparable ways. Villain Bane is very scary-looking, with his mask and bulked-up aggression. The movie opens with a terrifying plane takeover/crash; weapons include guns, knives, bows and arrows, bombs, fists, and more. A dead teen boy's body is shown washed up outside a sewer grate. Batman and Selina are at odds over Batman's ""no guns, no killing"" rule."

The movie shows the impact of the bullets and the arrows -- including those shot at a bird and a cat -- as well as plenty of blood.

In one case, it's just a couple of wolves versus a couple of wolves, but toward the end of the movie, it's two entire wolf packs about to go to war, and they look fierce and frightening. Humphrey and Kate have to evade three angry bears. A stampede nearly kills some wolves (but they're saved). The mother alpha makes humorously off-putting threats about ripping anatomical parts off and shoving them down throats. The 3-D version of the movie makes these potentially frightening images more intense for younger viewers."

Major and secondary characters are killed in various ways -- bullets to the head or heart, slit throats, arrows to the heart, smashed skulls, knives to the gut, snapped necks, and more.

The goriest scenes are of a man who's electrocuted (he's hosed down as he turns an electric stunning device on), a police officer who's thrown off a bridge by a gorilla, and a man plummeting into the water from a falling helicopter.

Most characters die off screen. The movie's climax includes a special effects-heavy supernatural fight between characters (including a stream of green vomit) but little brutality.

There are battles between phantom armies and the king's army, and then Ravenna's army defeats the king's army and is said to have murdered everyone left in the castle. The queen's creepy brother admits that he has stared at Snow White and then basically attempts to rape her (he gets on top of her forcefully, but she injures him and escapes). Various groups of the Queen's army fight Snow White, the huntsman, and the duke with axes, swords, and arrows. The dark forest is full of frightening creatures that can poison or maim."

Many frightening scenes will scare younger viewers used to more benign animated movies. Some of the ghosts that Norman can speak to are shown with fatal injuries and/or obvious reasons for their deaths. A character dies on screen. Many scenes feature either a corpse (Norman has to ""wrestle"" with one in one gross sequence) or falling-apart zombies. The kids think they're going to be ripped apart by the monsters, who chase them in a long sequence that includes tense moments and some startling ""jump"" scenes. The witch's ghost is very loud and destructive and nearly kills Norman and his family; it also causes a very ominous/scary cloud and sets off hostile sparks and blasts of electric energy. The townsfolk become a bloodthirsty mob ready to use their weapons (including guns) on the witch, zombies, or anyone who appears to be aligned with them.

Myers' mother commits suicide by putting a gun to her head -- not shown, but heard. In one scene, two drunk sanitarium workers sneak in after hours and begin to rape a female patient before they are killed by Myers. Many pets are killed, but viewers only see evidence photos.

A headmaster pretty much invites a young girl’s classmates to shun her for supposedly having misbehaved; he humiliates her in public. Talk of how a character commits suicide (jumping to her death).
17,1260448,103,The Spirit,93819171-8fbe-443b-849f-3cdce4eedf25,4.0,"Constant, hyper-stylized, bloody action. Characters are knifed, shot, punched (in the head, groin, stomach, and more), run over with cars, struck with arrows, impaled with weapons, exploded into bloody gobbets, encouraged to commit suicide, decapitated, punched, and more. Not surprisingly, there are plenty of dead bodies as a consequence. Characters also break necks with their bare hands. A genetic experiment gone wrong (a foot with a head sticking out of the ankle) is dissolved in acid. Disembodied eyeballs are seen swirling in a drain, and a severed finger is seen moving under its own power. Bloody wounds are seen in hyper-stylized contrast, so the blood seems white. Some of the characters, in comic-book fashion, have abilities that make them impervious or insensible to violence."

Max's mother shoots herself (you don't see the act, but you hear the gunshot and see him as a grieving six-year-old). One of the main characters also dies, and it's a heartbreaking scene. Mary attempts to commit suicide, and Max has many anxiety attacks that land him in an institution where he's given shock therapy."

And at one point, it looks like she has actually died, which could be more disturbing. The Martian ladies, especially the Supervisor, are an imposing, menacing bunch, and the Supervisor always looks and sounds like she's giving mean orders. Gribble is nearly executed by firing squad (the Martians have huge gun-like weapons). There are some foot chases, and the climactic rush to save Mom and return to Earth is tense."

Weapons include guns, knives, and kitchen tools. A lengthy and especially violent scene shows a struggle with a gun, then a man getting stabbed repeatedly and awkwardly (he fights back, grunts, staggers, and falls, with much blood on the walls and his killers).

In one scene, an angel slices off his own wings and stitches up the bloody wounds. A possessed old lady bites a man's neck; she's hit in the head with a frying pan and eventually shot. A swarm of bugs attacks. Other disturbing imagery includes a man hanging on an upside-down cross with pulsing boils all over his body. He explodes and sends lethal acid flying.

The scenes with owl-to-owl combat are dark and often feature extreme slow-motion close-ups. Several owls die -- one falls into fire, and others are killed during combat.

An early scene shows a boy nearly drowning (spooky underwater shots) and then, at home, fearing his angry father. Electric voltage is used against jumpers, leaving them looking stressed and pained.

Men and dogs are transformed into aliens by stretching, melting, sprouting tentacles, and forming hideous teeth. An autopsy is performed close up as organs are taken from it. Dogs are stalked and killed by aliens, other dogs, and by humans.

A man's head is obliterated by a series of stomps; his mangled body is dangled for all to see. In another scene, a naked woman is smashed into a wall until her head is obliterated. Characters are literally covered in blood after assaults, and murder victims are seen with their eyes stabbed out and a butcher's knife protruding from their skull. All of this is depicted with excruciatingly realistic makeup/special effects, with grisly detail."

Additionally, characters argue quite often, and the creatures sometimes make disturbing screeching noises."

The boxtrolls are at first presented in a way that might scare little viewers -- yellow eyes, hissing noises -- but they soon become much friendlier. Boxtrolls, including the ones Eggs is closest to, are captured and presumed dead on a few different occasions; most disturbing is a scene in which it appears that they've all been smashed flat. In their own home, some of the boxtrolls are electrocuted as they work on their gadgets, with no apparent harm. The film opens on a dark and stormy night, with a crying baby being carried away by boxtrolls (a scene that could upset younger kids until they realize the baby is OK). At the end of the movie, a key character explodes after ignoring a dangerous allergy that causes disturbing swelling, visions, and angry outbursts (an earlier episode is treated with leeches). Madame Frou Frou sings a strident song about killing the boxtrolls that gets the crowd worked up. Winnie is rather bloodthirsty, fixated on imagining -- and describing -- all the things the boxtrolls might do to her if they caught her.

There is one brief scene of a disliked elder dying and numerous scenes of peril. The community risks starvation if it can't find animals to hunt. In one scene, a pregnant woman lies in danger of dying if she does not get any meat to eat soon. In another, a sick dog is threatened to be sacrificed until someone steps forward to try to diagnose and treat its illness instead. Characters discuss building weapons to hunt and kill animals with a gun or a spear to the heart. A child asks her older brother if he will die, and the deaths of parents in the recent past is discussed. Animal parts are used for rituals and include a caribou heart and the bones of a dead animal. And, throughout the film, a trio of young characters narrowly evades death from falling into ice, careening off into a crevasse, or drowning. There also are a few scenes of menacing crows and conjured smoke monsters meant to intimidate or suffocate their victims."

There are plenty of physical altercations -- mostly fistfights -- and, in one instance, two children beat each other up while a watching crowd cheers. Objects such as an umbrella, a ceramic bowl, and a hammer are used to ""injure"" others, and a policeman attempts to choke the Tramp. All these instances are somehow related to the gag at hand and are used to generate laughs despite their -- at face value -- more serious nature.

A character is fried inside a tanning booth. A character is devoured by a shark, with clouds of blood in the water. A man is strangled, and a gory photograph of the body is shown.

A boy holds a gun on a man who's threatening his mother, and a boy is slapped in the face by a man. There's also a very startling scene in which seemingly cute bunnies turn ferocious."

The movie takes place after WWIII, and shows images of a nuclear explosion.

There's constant fighting, bashing, burning, stabbing, slicing, whipping, slaying, brain-spattering, and nose-slicing, plus severed heads and limbs, with large amounts of blood.

Some fighting. Plenty of action and peril, but most of it comes with a lighthearted, adventurous tone. A giant octopus wreaks havoc in some scenes, which scare younger kids -- as could a creepy sequence involving a gate to the Egyptian underworld.

Arnold smashes his space helmet on Mars and his face bulges and explodes (in a dream). The many fight scenes include shooting, punching, slicing, kicking, breaking bones, and spurting blood. Women fight each other and are shot and killed. The main character also punches a female, and uses an innocent bystander as a shield (the bystander is riddled with bullets and dies, and the scene is played for humor). Dead bodies are stepped on. Arms are ripped off, and characters are briefly tortured. Some of the visual effects are somewhat disturbing as well, such as the hero pulling a large tracking device from his nose."

A girl who drinks lye spits up blood, convulses, and dies. Another girl dies immolating herself in a basement fire. A story refers to how two young boys walked out in the ocean and drowned; in another tale mentioned again and again, a boy drowns in muddy marshland. Faces and figures pop out unexpectedly, and the Woman in Black is terrifying. She screams and is shown hanging and lurking in rooms moments before children die. People catch glimpses of the ghosts of dead children, and two other characters die suddenly, but it's not gory."
