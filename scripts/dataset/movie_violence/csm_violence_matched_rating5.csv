Characters are crushed by a dumbwaiter, shot by arrows, bludgeoned with guns and tea kettles, strangled, shot in the face; they die spitting and choking on dark blood, with terrible gurgling noises. Violence is frequently given a comic spin -- e.g., when a character accidentally shoots another with a crossbow, the family upbraids her for being a klutz, not for taking a human life. Small children die and are involved in violence, too; at one point, a young boy shoots another character bloodily and is knocked out by a punch. Dead bodies are seen in extended scenes; the camera lingers on a severed head as characters exchange light banter, unaffected."

Blood and tissue shown streaming through tubes, with liquid noises. Abortion clinic protestors hold up signs with graphic photos (e.g., unborn baby with dismembered limbs). A woman has an abortion via RU486; viewers see her retching into toilet (no vomit visible), groaning with clearly agonizing pain; blood, bloody chunks fall out from between her legs. At scene's end, camera pulls up to show bloody spatters, pools all over bathroom. Technicians reassemble bodies of aborted fetuses to make sure nothing's left in mother's body; viewers see very small realistic dead fetus's head, face, arm. A character sees realistic pre-term dead fetus in petri dish that she examines with an instrument, lifting small, bloody hand.
